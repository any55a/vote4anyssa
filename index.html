<h1>Vote Anyssa Pinkney for Junior Class President!</h1>
<h2>"Theres a diffrence between bring involed and being commited" -Koach Jon
<p>Voting for me will be a great choice because I am determined, commited, versatile, and very responsible.</p>
<h3>To say I am all of these characteristics is one thing but I can prove it.</h3>
<p>As Junior Class President I will ensure that everything from decorating the hallways to coordinating prom will be done to the greatest extent. It does not end there, I will make sure everything for not just this year but also next years activites will be well coordinated. Also, I have previous expirence being in the student council, therefore I know how everything goes already. There is no need to put a new person in the mix who barely knows how we do things and we have no time to train someone who is supposed to be running this council.</p>
